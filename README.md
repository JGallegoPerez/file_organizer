# file_organizer
*A bash script to organize your files more easily on your Linux machine.*
## Description
Sometimes we end up with a mess of files spread out through a labyrinth of directories and subdirectories. Fixing this manually can be too time consuming. Running Linux commands can be a better solution, but we might have forgotten how to use some specific commands...
Here is a bash script featuring a menu to iteratively list, delete or move files. 
## Features
- Listing files by size
- Listing files by extension
- Removing specific files
- Removing files by extension
- Moving specific files
- Moving files by extension
## Instructions
Copy the file *organizer.sh* into the directory that will work as parent directory for all the files you want to manipulate. Run it on the shell as a bash script. 
The iterative menu will make the rest self-explanatory.
